    I was making a reverse engineering challenge for this competition, it went succesfully and the chall ran perfectly fine.
    But here's the plot twist, I was making the challenge in my phone. Now that my phone is dead forever, I lost the source for the challenge :(
    Can you help me find the source code back? I created the challenge on an online C compiler website.
    I don't remember the website name, but I do remember the company that made it. It was "Pawera Labs" or something.
