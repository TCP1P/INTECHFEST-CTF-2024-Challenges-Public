## Description

I recently forked a public repository on GitHub. 
After a few days I deleted my repo. However, my friend informed me
that he are still able to access one of my commits from that fork which commit a3xxxxx. 
Can you figure out how this happened? See the public repo below.

- Wrap string INTECHFEST{<value>}
